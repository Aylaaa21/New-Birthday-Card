        <h1>Happiest Birthday Isuru Sann</h1>
        <p>
            To my Tsukiii, my hansamu, my light under the stars â€”<br><br>

            Happiest birthday, my love.<br><br>
            Thank you for being youâ€”for all the strength, kindness, and quiet ways youâ€™ve helped me,
            even without knowing it sometimes. Watching you chase your dreams and become everything youâ€™ve worked so hard to be...
            Iâ€™m just so proud of you.<br><br>

            All I ever want is to see your smileâ€”genuine and full of light. Thatâ€™s more than enough for me.<br><br>

            Itâ€™s so magical to have met you on this journey of life, even if we canâ€™t walk it side by side.
            I still remember how you understood me without me ever needing to speak.
            If fate is kind, I hope to see you again someday.
            And if notâ€¦ please, just be happy. With or without me.<br><br>

            I know I canâ€™t always be by your side, but Iâ€™ll always be somewhere nearâ€¦
            watching over you from the shadows, cheering for you in silence, loving you quietly.<br><br>

            May this year bring you peace, laughter, and everything youâ€™ve ever wished for.<br><br>

            With all my heart,<br>
            Your one and only babeâ€¦ the one who calls you bubs.
